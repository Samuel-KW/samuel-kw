 * # Quizlet MathJax Integration: Chrome Extension
 * 
 * A Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates MathJax support into Quizlet, enhancing the platform's capability to display mathematical notation across various study modes. This project showcases the ability to extend and improve functionality of popular web applications, particularly in the educational technology sector.
 * 
 * ## Key Features:
 * 
 * 1. **Cross-Mode Compatibility**: Implements MathJax rendering across multiple Quizlet study modes, including flashcards, learn, write, spell, test, and match.
 * 
 * 2. **Dynamic Content Handling**: Utilizes MutationObserver to detect and process dynamically loaded content, ensuring LaTeX rendering in real-time as users interact with Quizlet.
 * 
 * 3. **Mode-Specific Implementations**: Custom observers for each Quizlet study mode, demonstrating adaptability to varying page structures and content loading mechanisms.
 * 
 * 4. **Efficient DOM Traversal**: Implements smart element selection and traversal to identify and target relevant content for LaTeX rendering.
 * 
 * 5. **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Designed to seamlessly blend with Quizlet's existing functionality without disrupting the user experience.
 * 
 * ## Technical Highlights:
 * 
 * 1. **Advanced DOM Manipulation**: 
 *    - Custom `waitUntil` function for asynchronous element detection.
 *    - Utilizes DOM traversal to locate and process LaTeX content.
 * 
 * 2. **Modular Architecture**:
 *    - Encapsulated functionality within the `QuizletLatex` class for maintainability and potential future expansions.
 * 
 * 3. **Adaptive Content Observation**:
 *    - Implements a versatile `observe` method to watch for content changes across different Quizlet interfaces.
 * 
 * 4. **Intelligent Rendering Triggers**:
 *    - Filters mutation events to trigger LaTeX rendering only when necessary, optimizing performance.
 * 
 * 5. **Cross-Mode Compatibility**:
 *    - Handles various Quizlet modes (flashcards, learn, write, spell, test, match) with mode-specific logic.
 * 
 * ## Skills Demonstrated:
 * 
 * - Chrome Extension Development
 * - Advanced JavaScript Programming
 * - DOM Manipulation and Traversal
 * - Asynchronous Programming
 * - Integration with Third-Party Libraries (MathJax)
 * - Educational Technology Enhancement
 * - User Experience Improvement
 * 
 * ## Development Challenges Overcome:
 * 
 * - Adapting to Quizlet's diverse study mode interfaces and content loading patterns.
 * - Ensuring efficient and timely LaTeX rendering without impacting Quizlet's performance.
 * - Implementing a solution that works across Quizlet's various study modes and page structures.
 * - Handling dynamically loaded content in single-page application architecture.
 * 
 * This project exemplifies the ability to identify and address gaps in existing educational platforms, showcasing both technical proficiency in web extension development and an understanding of user needs in educational technology. It demonstrates skills in creating seamless integrations that enhance user experience without disrupting the core functionality of the target application.
